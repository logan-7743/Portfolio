# Logan Bishop's MSFE/MSFM Prep Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repository! This is the central place where I’ll be dropping all code, notebooks, and projects as I prepare for the Master’s in Financial Engineering (MSFE) / Master’s in Financial Mathematics (MSFM) program I plan to attend in August 2027.

## About

This repository will evolve over time to include code and projects covering topics relevant to quantitative finance, including but not limited to:

* Stochastic calculus & partial differential equations
* Option pricing models (Black–Scholes, Binomial Trees)
* Quantitative trading strategies and backtesting
* Risk management techniques
* Numerical methods and Monte Carlo simulations
* Machine learning applications in finance

Expect to see Jupyter notebooks, Python scripts, data files, and documentation as I build and refine these projects.
